<p>Thank you for your commitment to being sober through The Process. You have chosen a life changing program that will enable you to live a happy and contented life free from the desire for alcohol. </p>
<p>Here are a few house rules that you need to agree to: </p>
<ul>
<li>You have read and agreed to these conditions.
<li>You are willing to take responsibility for your sobriety and actions - from this point.
<li>You will complete The Process worksheets quickly and honestly – you won’t leave any information out! The Process will only work with your complete honesty.
<li>Please understand that The Process does not have an opinion on religion, atheism, agnosticism or any spiritual (or otherwise) views. This is your business alone.
<li>The Process programme is not based, nor does it give direction, on any spiritual belief system; our only desire is to help you to lead a happy and contented life free from alcohol.  (Although, after some members have worked through The Process, they have reported some form of a ‘spiritual awakening’ or a major shift in themselves.
<li>You understand the importance of honesty - with yourself and with the information you write.
<li>Please do not leave any information out no matter how serious, sick, embarrassing or private.
<li>You accept that alcohol is causing problems in your life and when you drink you do not have control over alcohol. Because alcoholism is so powerful we do not give any guarantee on your sobriety or your outcomes.
<li>You accept that your sobriety is your sole responsibility and that, although we deliver The Process to you, it is your responsibility to follow it thoroughly.
</ul>
<p>The miracle of The Process is that it teaches individuals to analyse and understand themselves, and, by following the programme and doing the work - learn how to handle situations that would have once baffled them.  </p>
<p>The Process is an inside out program. </p>

<p>We know that resentment, anger, hate and fear are the main cause of all our problems – we understand that alcohol abuse is a symptom of our problems.  </p>
<p>Once we clear our past from resentment, anger, hate and fear - and have addressed those we have hurt, we stop being selfish, dishonest, fearful and inconsiderate. Being free from the primary damaging emotions, resentment, anger and fear is life-long work that we will learn to do. (Use Dr. Pete as an example). </p>
<p>
We’ll have a look at these primary harmful emotions, but first, let’s explain how we end up with long-held resentments.

<p>It’s morning, I’m at work and still have not had coffee. Already someone has done something to irritate me – only a small thing. I can’t exactly
‘put my finger on why’, but now I feel slightly uncomfortable, a discomfort like an itch I cannot scratch, however, I carry on and superficially
forget that ‘irritant’ moment. But it is still there, deep underneath, like a circling shark. </p>
<p>Maybe a few hours pass, and then somebody else does something I find annoying (‘How many times must I tell them not to stack the boxes like that!’
or, ‘Why can’t they just put the toilet seat down!’, or&hellip; [insert annoyance here]) but I frown and shake it off and continue with the day. But it is
still there; underneath, the shark is joined by another. </p>
<p>Seemingly trivial irritants continue (a friend cancels golf at the last minute; the sun is too bright; a partner doesn’t answer a text; a co-worker
takes yet ‘another’ smoke break; someone snaps their gum too loudly; a car cuts in front of yours; someone else’s child is screaming; it’s raining) &mdash; I
push the irritation I feel down, because that’s what I have always done. The sharks gather, the water boils. </p>
<p>Then &mdash; I answer my mobile. My partner asks me when I will be home, why I am late again, didn’t I remember they had to go out! I hear the
kids yelling in the background. I snap back at them and push the phone roughly into my jacket pocket. I resent my partner for being unreasonable and
demanding but I finish up and leave work and slam the door on my way out. On the drive home, the motorway traffic is heavier, the drivers are more
stupid than usual. I sound the horn as I pass them (idiots!), my foot pressing on the accelerator. I don’t realise until I park the car, how tightly
I had gripped the steering wheel.  </p>
<p>Imagine &mdash; what would a life time of constant irritations, that continually build to annoyance, anger and resentment, look like? &mdash; A
festering open wound delivering a slow poison: a cacophony of damaging chemicals that are the body’s natural response to harmful emotion. The discomfort
and psychological, physical and emotional pain caused by this poison are intolerable, but you don’t know how to make it go away. </p>
<p>What is it up until now, that has either, temporarily relieved the pressure, or, allowed us to explode, vent, or otherwise, go ballistic?  We have a
drink; alcohol has always been our fix.  </p>
<p>But it is temporary, and it does not, will not and cannot ever — address the underlying issue. </p>
<p>This is what The Process does. </p>

		<h3>Defects of Character</h3>
		<p>A person acting on the 5 basic character defects would appear to be:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Selfish </strong>&mdash; Lacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure.</li>
			<li><strong>Dishonest </strong>&mdash; Having lost the ability to be honest, with self and/or others.</li>
			<li><strong>Self-Seeking </strong>&mdash; Concern for oneself before others. ‘It’s all about me’.</li>

			<li><strong>Inconsiderate </strong>&mdash; Acting without consideration; Thoughtless; Rash; Not taking into account or trying to understand another person's situation.</li>

		<p>Defects of Character</p></strong>
		<p>We are now going to look at the 5 basic defects of character all humans can have, every human being has these to some effect but for those of us who have problems with alcohol or are alcoholic these defects are so strong they are stopping us from being who we really would want to be.</p>
		<p>These defects are</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Selfish </strong>- lacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure.</li>
			<li><strong>Dishonest </strong>- We have lost the ability to be totally honest with ourselves or others and when we are, we usually hurt             other people or ourselves, usually by opening our mouths.</li>
			<li><strong>Self-seeking </strong>- concern for oneself before others. It’s all about me.</li>
			<li><strong>Frightened </strong>- afraid or anxious.</li>
			<li><strong>Inconsiderate </strong>- acting without consideration; thoughtless; rash.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We have many types of character defects and the ones above are our core basic defects. They are like the basic colours red, yellow, blue and when you mix these together you can create an infinite number of colours.

		<p>I am now going to present examples for you to study and follow.</p>
		<p>As I go through my affected Basic Instincts in the example worksheet you will see the reasons why the basic instincts, were affected. </p>
		<strong>My father – Bernard: </strong>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Self Esteem – How I think and feel about myself. </p>
			<p>Dad didn’t come to my games – I’d feel dejected and unloved. I saw the other kids’ parents there which made me feel bad about myself, and I knew dad was going to the hotel to drink.  </p></li>
			<li><p>Pride – How I think others see me. </p>
			<p>When dad dropped me off I would imagine when other parents and kids looked at me and think I wasn’t very good or that my father didn’t like or love me.</p>  </li>
			<li><p>Emotional Security – General sense of wellbeing, feeling emotionally stable and happy with myself.</p> 
			<p>This was affected because I didn’t feel emotionally stable and I wasn’t happy about my dad going to the pub instead of watching my game. This affected my emotions greatly.</p></li>
			<li><p>Financial – Basic desire for money, property and possessions.</p>
			<p>I wanted people to respect and love me. I wanted success.</p></li>
			<li><p>Ambitions – My plans, dreams and goals for the future.</p>
			<p>No, if anything it made more determined.</p></li>
			<li><p>Personal Relations</p>
			<p>My relationship with my father was affected because his drinking was more important than spending time with me; also, he didn’t communicate with me.</p></li>
			<li><p>Sex Relations.</p>
			<p>Because of dad’s inability to show me attention and love I went looking for other relationships with women and gangs etc.</p></li>
		<ul> 
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> Shown in my example are how my Basic Instincts were affected by my father’s behaviour. (Basic Instincts can sometimes be positive e.g. My father triggering my ‘Financial’ Instinct made me determined to succeed financially.)</p>
		<p>However, for this sheet, we are practicing awareness of how our Basic Instincts are affected negatively, or harmfully. </p>

		<strong>Mother – Pauline </strong>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Self Esteem – How I think and feel about myself. </p>

			<li><p>Pride – How I think other people view or feel about me</p>
			<p>I felt they viewed me as weak and incapable of being able to look after myself.  </p></li>
			<li><p>Emotional Security – General sense of wellbeing, feeling emotionally stable with myself. Being comfortable and at ease, not nervous with self.</p>

			<li>We tick the instincts we believe were affected by the actions of others.  </li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is not a box ticking exercise. The Process is a lifelong practice (if you choose) — think carefully and diligently and you will begin to see a clear pattern of your behaviour.</p> 
		<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - When we have anger, resentment, hate etc, towards people we won’t be able to be relieved of it until we address which of our basic instincts have been hurt or threatened.</p>",

		<strong>My Part:   </strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Where was I to Blame?</li>
			<li>What was my part in this? </li>
			<li>What was the exact nature of my wrongs to this person, institution or principle?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In this column you focus only on the part you played (we do not blame others).  <p>
		<p>Column 4 is where we stop blaming others for our resentments, anger, hurt and/or feelings of being threatened & general ill will toward people, institutions and principles. </p>
		<p><strong>THIS IS WHERE WE GET TO THE ROOT CAUSES</strong></p>
		<p><strong>CRUCIAL READING</strong></p>
		<p>Remember, we are willing to go to every length to free ourselves from harmful emotions; it is only then we can release our addictions.  </p>
		<p>It is not possible to change others, but we can change ourselves, so it is crucial to find the part we played in each held resentment, no matter what. This is agreed to in the ‘rule’ section: *You accept that your sobriety is your sole responsibility and that, although we deliver The Process to you, it is your responsibility to follow it thoroughly. We investigate ourselves truthfully even when we think we’re innocent. This does not take away what people have done to us. </p>
		<p>Accept that we have no power over others and what they did to us, but we do have the power over what we do from here and into the future. </p>
		<p>We have blamed these people — but like us, they have been spiritually, emotionally and mentally unwell. They will carry this burden by themselves, sometimes to the grave.  </p>
		<p>I include the character defect - INCONSIDERATE - in the next column to help you define how I considered I was to blame, the part I played, and the exact nature of my wrong. (If we can see we were inconsiderate, then this will set you free from resentment.) </p>
		<p>Now we’ll focus only on our part. The following are examples and descriptions on how to forgive. To forgive is a choice. To forgive is a powerful step in resolving anger and resentment. Moving through the work quickly and thoughtfully. </p>
		<strong>INSERT EXAMPLE WORKSHEET AND I WILL DISCUSS HOW WE DO THIS, THESE ARE REAL EXAMPLES AND THIS COLUMN IS SO CRITICAL TO FREEDOM BECAUSE IT GIVES US THE ABILITY TO FORGIVE </strong>
		<p>When you are positive you fully understand and accept/acknowledge your part in each situation, and you honestly look at what your part is, in relation to each of these — you are on the highway to freedom.  </p>
		<p>Below again I have provided the examples of MY PART to assist you to find your part.</p>

		<p><strong>Father – Bernard </strong></p>
		<p>I realised my father was an alcoholic and he did not understand he had a problem. If he did, he did not know what to do about it. I am sure he didn’t like his how his drinking controlled him. Dad was powerless over his drinking. He was a kind and generous man.</p><br/>
		 
		<p><strong>Mother — Pauline </strong></p>
		<p>I realised that mum didn’t want to die. Cancer took her, we were both powerless over cancer. It took her away from everyone. It wasn’t her fault.</p><br/>
		<p><strong>Friend – Vernon </strong></p>
		<p>Vernon had a violent father and older brother who both bullied him. They would beat him up. He was scared and defensive. He was angry, and his only avenue was to bully me and others. When we grew bigger he stopped. </p><br/>
		<p><strong>Financial advisor – Steve </strong></p>
		<p>I should have listened to my wife and friends. I should have done the research on the company and known what they were investing my money in.  </p><br/>

		<p>God didn’t take my mother; cancer did. I realised I just needed someone to blame. </p><br/>
		<p><strong>Employer – Mr Talbot </strong></p>
		<p>I realised another person misinformed him about me, but I wanted to blame someone. I didn’t like working there. </p><br/>
		<p><strong>Uncle Selwyn </strong></p>
		<p>I realise he was a very sick man, mentally and emotionally. I also discovered he had been abused as a child by his teachers. He had never told anyone this until he was dying. I realised he had carried the burden of being abused and being an abuser himself. I realised Uncle Selwyn had been in a living hell all his life, although it didn’t stop him from abusing me, I found space in my heart to forgive him. I wished him peace as I would anyone who was sick. </p><br/>

		<p>As discussed in the last slide, you can now understand your default defects relative to each resentment you have held. </p>
		<p>Read carefully below.  </p>
		<p>You may hold on to deep resentment and anger toward people and situations where you were clearly not at fault — that is natural. But you still have resentment. You need to let go of this residual resentment for a happy and contented life.  </p>
		<p>The last slide described how and when to use the INCONSIDERATE defect. I showed how the people who harmed you, were SPIRITUALLY, MENTALLY and EMOTIONALLY UNWELL. Knowing this allows us to understand we have fallen in to the default – INCONSIDERATE.  This will free us and allow us to begin to forgive and heal. And to forgive and heal means freedom. </p>

		<p>WHEN YOU SEEM TO BE STUCK JUST KEEP MOVING FORWARD, THIS IS NOT ABOUT PERFECTION IT IS ABOUT MOMENTUM AND ACTION. </p></strong>
		<p>Once you have completed your sheets on resentment and anger and are certain that you have covered all people, institutions and principles that you have resented, were angry at, hated, felt hurt or threatened by or felt ill will toward then you should now see how these resentments have had control over you and your life. </p>
		<p>To summarise the resentment and anger sheet. Even when something is not our fault and sometimes it is not. Someone may have done something unprovoked, we still have a way to deal with it. Even when we cannot find where we were at fault, we can find where our REACTION was at fault. </p>
		<p>Maybe we feel we have been offended and this may have caused us to be fearful, but in this program, we have learnt that we have an inner resource that allows us not to react in a fearful way to negative actions that come our way. </p>
		<p>As we start to see when our basic instincts are out of alignment we are instinctively aware which of the instincts are out of alignment and we can now adjust our reaction and actions, so they do not have control over us. Some of you will pray for guidance, some of you will meditate, others may contemplate, and others may just go and talk with a friend, but we must not think that we are the centre of the universe. </p>
		<p>Once sheet 2 is completed you will have a process of working through for the rest of your life, yes, we have more work to complete but you have had a good look at yourself and how your anger and resentment has affected you and your life. Now you can start a fresh and this was the beginning. We are now going to address our fears in a similar way as to how we addressed our resentments and anger </p>

		<p>We all have fears some are natural, and we need these. Then there are fears that we just don’t know where they come from and they can paralyse us into inaction. Fear steals from us and stops us growing into the person we really want to be.</p>
		<h3>UNDERSTANDING FEAR AND ANXIETY  </h3>
		<p>Fear starts with us becoming </p>
		<ol>
			<li>nervous about something or someone and then moves up the scale for us to become </li>
			<li>Anxious about someone, something or we feel something could happen and then it moves into </li>
			<li>Fear, and we become frightened that something bad is going to happen to us or someone else. </li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
		<p>Procrastination is another form of fear where we just keep putting things off until they cause us major problems, or we reluctantly address the problem and then wonder why we made it so hard for ourselves.  </p>
		<p>Many of you will have experienced the above emotions many times in your life and many of us have gone off to the Doctors and we are given some type of pill. Sometimes this is necessary, and it can be helpful, but what I see is many people staying on the prescribed pill and not coming off them. The fear or problem has not been addressed it has been cloaked over, so the fear or anxiety is still there. </p>
		<p>I will give you an example- I have a friend who has a bad hip and It occasionally causes him much pain. He sometimes takes an off the shelf pain killer and this relieves the pain for a period of time. The pain has been taken away, but the problem is still there waiting to cause him more problems, that is why we address resentment, anger and fear in The Process because you will be able to see where this comes from and how to remedy it, if you choose. </p>
		<p>Before you start I will again supply examples for you to follow and you can start filling in the fears prompt sheet. </p>
		
		<p><strong>YOUR ACTION</strong> - Please print the FEARS PROMPT SHEET-SHEET 3 - <strong>COLUMN 1</strong></p>

	"html" : "<h3>Column 2- Why do I Have the Fear</h3>

	<p>As in the resentment and Anger prompt sheet I am going to write a small overview as to why I have these fears.</p>
	<p>You saw in the resentment and anger pages that by writing a little paragraph on each topic. This allows you to have a better understanding of the fear and will allow me to be condense this into a few words for the worksheet.</p>
	<p>The importance again is for YOU to understand nobody else, just you.</p>
	<p>Let us begin</p>
	<p><strong>Rejection </strong>- When I was we grew up in a predominately protestant community and we were catholic, and I attended the local catholic school. I wanted to go to a protestant school like my other mates, so I would be accepted. I thought that by going to a catholic school I was scared and felt that I was not like them and they would reject me.</p>
	<p><strong>Loneliness </strong>- Again when growing up I wanted for everyone to like me and I wanted to fit in with all the guys. I wanted to have friends. Also, my head told me lots of things.</p>
	<p><strong>Failure </strong>- Scared of not being good enough, when I was with people I wanted them to think I was smart or clever or good at things and this made me anxious as well.</p>
	<p><strong>Disapproval </strong>- Not being seen as being able to do things well. Being seen as not reliable or able to do things.</p>
	<p><strong>Poverty </strong>- We grew up poor and I hated not being to have new clothes, a nice car, to go on holidays, having no pocket money, watching mum and dad struggle. This also drove me to succeed.</p>
	<p><strong>Financial </strong>- I am scared of not being able to earn money and I did not want to be like my parents.</p>
	<p><strong>Procrastination </strong>- When I was young I was scared to do some things because I thought I wasn’t good enough and other people thought I wasn’t good enough. I always thought people who had more than me or were better than me at different things, that this made them better people than me. I wasn’t confident in my abilities. This has been with me most of my life and has stopped me performing to my real ability.</p>
	<h3> YOUR ACTION-</h3>
	<p>Now you can write your small overview for each of your fears and once you have completed these you can transfer a condensed version of these into <strong>COLUMN 2 </strong>- WHY DO I HAVE THE FEAR.</p>
	<p>Please use my example as to how I have condensed the information into column 2.</p>
	<p>Now we take our paragraph and review each one to ensure we feel comfortable that we have the right words to describe each situation</p>
	<p>Once we are happy with the reason of why we have the fear, anxiety or nervousness we then move onto column 3.</p>
	<p>REMEMBER- This is for YOUR benefit, it allows you to see and understand why you have the fear, once you understand why you have the fear it starts to have less control over you.</p>

	"html" : "<h3>Column 3- Which Part of Self Has Failed Me?</h3>
	<p><strong>PLEASE STUDY AND UNDERSTAND EACH OF THE  3 SELF’S,</strong> this is critically important to understand as you will see and start to understand how you can address your fears, anxiety and nervousness.</p> 
	<p>These are</p>
	<p><strong>Self-reliance</strong> - Reliance on ones, own capabilities, abilities, judgement, own power and resources rather than those of others.</p>
	<p><strong>Self-confidence</strong> - Trust in our ability and skills to achieve our goals, believing and knowing what we are capable of and what we are not capable of.</p>
	<p><strong>Self-discipline</strong> - The ability to control our feelings and emotions and overcome our weaknesses. To stick at a task or tasks. To see projects through to completion no matter how hard they become or what problems arise.</p>
	<p>Because I wrote a brief overview of why I have the fear, I can now see where  </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Self-reliance</li>
		<li>Self-confidence and </li>
		<li>Self-discipline failed me,</li>
		<li>It becomes simple when you have your overview, so let’s have a look at what I do in my example in column 3.</li>
	<p><strong>Rejection </strong>- I wanted to be accepted by others.</p>
	<p>So what part of self, failed me, I ticked</p>
	<p><strong>Self-Reliance </strong>- because I didn’t believe in my own capabilities and didn’t know what they were, also I did not have many positive or experienced mentors</p>
	<p><strong>Self Confidence </strong>- Because I didn’t know my own capabilities I didn’t know or have self-confidence.</p>
	<p><strong>Loneliness </strong>- I wanted to be popular and liked by people. </p>
	<p>So, what part of self, failed me-I ticked</p>
	<p><strong>Self-Reliance </strong>- Again I didn’t believe in my own capabilities as I didn’t know what they were, and again not being mentored or guided.</p>
	<p><strong>Self Confidence </strong>- Again because I didn’t know my own capabilities and skills and be confident to communicate with people. </p>
	<p><strong>Failure </strong>- Was scared of not being good enough</p>
	<p>So, what part of self, failed me-I ticked</p>
	<p><strong>Self-Reliance </strong>- I didn’t have the belief or knowledge of my own capabilities and didn’t trust my judgement.</p>
	<p><strong>Self Confidence </strong>- Because I didn’t know my abilities or how good they were I wasn’t confident to use my abilities, so I would not take risks because of becoming a failure.</p>
	<p><strong>Self-Discipline </strong>- I did try certain things because I knew I wasn’t disciplined and knew I would have to stick at it and I couldn’t be bothered because I thought it was too hard. </p>
	<p><strong>Disapproval </strong>- I wanted to be liked and thought of well.</p>
	<p>So, what part of self, failed me- I ticked</p>
	<p><strong>Self Confidence </strong>- I was not sure of my abilities so I would not push myself and if I did it would be under false confidence. I didn’t like being told off for doing the wrong thing.</p>
	<p><strong>Poverty </strong>- Being poor</p>
	<p>So, what part of self, failed me- I ticked</p>
	<p><strong>Self Confidence </strong>- Not trusting my own abilities and again not thinking I was good enough</p>
	<p><strong>Self-Discipline </strong>- Not having the ability to see through and focus on skills that I needed, also not realising that study would help me.</p>
	<p><strong>Financial </strong>- Not having enough money</p>
	<p>So, what part of self, failed me?</p>
	<p><strong>Self-Reliance </strong>- I was not sure or positive about my skills, knowledge or my own power. I felt like an imposter.</p>
	<p><strong>Self Confidence </strong>- I didn’t fully trust my skill or my own abilities.</p>
	<p><strong>Self-Discipline </strong>- I definitely didn’t have the ability to control my feelings and to stick at the task.</p>
	<p><strong>Procrastination </strong>- Because I might fail.</p>
	<p><strong>Self -Reliance </strong>- I was scared to rely on my own capabilities and power.</p>
	<p><strong>Self Confidence </strong>- I didn’t believe in my own capabilities all the time and didn’t understand or realise of what I was or could be capable of.</p>
	<p><strong>Self-Discipline </strong>- I didn’t have the discipline to stick to a task.</p>
	<p>(<strong>NOTE - I strongly recommend </strong> that you do this as it gives much more clarity and allows you to start making changes in how you react to your fears, because you now understand why you have the fear and how it affects you, it allows you to plan how you will go forward so that the fear is eventually reduced or removed, the fear does not affect you because you understand it)</p>
	<h3>YOUR ACTION – </h3>
	<p>Just like I have done above, write down </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Your Fear</li>
		<li>Why you have the Fear and</li>
		<li>Just like I did with, Which Part of Self has Failed, write down the reasons.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>I suggest that you place the definition I have provided on Self-Reliance, Self Confidence and Self-Discipline in front of you. As you go through this exercise you will start to see core reasons for the Fear developing.</p>

	<li>Self-esteem- Because I don’t want to be poor</li>
	<li>Pride- People won’t respect me.</li>
	<li>Emotional security- I will feel worthless.</li>
	<li>Financial- I won’t have money or assets.</li>
	<li>Ambitions- It could stop me achieving my dreams.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I haven’t included examples of all the fears as I know you will be gaining a better understanding of how this works.</p>
	<strong>NOTE - AGAIN I SUGGEST STRONGLY</strong> that you follow my example and write out why you think, your basic instincts are affected. This is again a powerful process as by thinking and writing it down gives you clarity and power, as you are going through this process you will find the fear and anxiety having less power over you. It starts leaving you.

	For each fear we search within ourselves to see where we were selfish, dishonest, self-seeking, frightened or inconsiderate. 
	Again, I will write out each fear and write a small reason as to why I was one or more of the above defects. Once you feel you understand then you can start writing yours out.
