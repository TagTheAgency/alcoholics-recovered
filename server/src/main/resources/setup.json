<p>Thank you for your commitment to being sober through The Process. You have chosen a life changing program that will enable you to live a happy and contented life free from the desire for alcohol. </p>
<p>Here are a few house rules that you need to agree to: </p>
<ul>
<li>You have read and agreed to these conditions.
<li>You are willing to take responsibility for your sobriety and actions - from this point.
<li>You will complete The Process worksheets quickly and honestly &mdash; you won&rsquo;t leave any information out! The Process will only work with your complete honesty.
<li>Please understand that The Process does not have an opinion on religion, atheism, agnosticism or any spiritual (or otherwise) views. This is your business alone.
<li>The Process programme is not based, nor does it give direction, on any spiritual belief system; our only desire is to help you to lead a happy and contented life free from alcohol.  (Although, after some members have worked through The Process, they have reported some form of a &ldquo;spiritual awakening&rsquo; or a major shift in themselves.
<li>You understand the importance of honesty - with yourself and with the information you write.
<li>Please do not leave any information out no matter how serious, sick, embarrassing or private.
<li>You accept that alcohol is causing problems in your life and when you drink you do not have control over alcohol. Because alcoholism is so powerful we do not give any guarantee on your sobriety or your outcomes.
<li>You accept that your sobriety is your sole responsibility and that, although we deliver The Process to you, it is your responsibility to follow it thoroughly.
</ul>
<p>The miracle of The Process is that it teaches individuals to analyse and understand themselves, and, by following the programme and doing the work - learn how to handle situations that would have once baffled them.  </p>
<p>The Process is an inside out program. </p>

<p>We know that resentment, anger, hate and fear are the main cause of all our problems &mdash; we understand that alcohol abuse is a symptom of our problems.  </p>
<p>Once we clear our past from resentment, anger, hate and fear - and have addressed those we have hurt, we stop being selfish, dishonest, fearful and inconsiderate. Being free from the primary damaging emotions, resentment, anger and fear is life-long work that we will learn to do. (Use Dr. Pete as an example). </p>
<p>
We&rsquo;ll have a look at these primary harmful emotions, but first, let&rsquo;s explain how we end up with long-held resentments.
</p>
<p>The following slides will show: </p>
<ol>
<li>The pathway to resentment: This overview will show where resentment begins, and the stages it takes until the end   stage, which is havoc. </li>
<li>Blaming others needs to stop &mdash; I will talk briefly about this. </li>
<li>There are 7 basic instincts we all have - understanding these will help you understand yourself, and learn how the instincts can become unbalanced.</li>
<li>There are 5-character defects &mdash; understanding and recognising these show us where we need to make a positive adjustment. </li>

<p>Resentment initially starts by us first becoming:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Irritated</strong>&mdash; Something or someone&rsquo;s actions and/or behaviour start to irritate us. Although these irritants may seem trivial - we become &hellip;</li>

<li><strong>Resentment!</strong></li>
</ul>

Together, anger and resentment create most of our problems beginning with the first step; irritation.

&ldquo;put my finger on why&rsquo;, but now I feel slightly uncomfortable, a discomfort like an itch I cannot scratch, however, I carry on and superficially
forget that &ldquo;irritant&rsquo; moment. But it is still there, deep underneath, like a circling shark. </p>
<p class='process-quote'>Maybe a few hours pass, and then somebody else does something I find annoying (&ldquo;How many times must I tell them not to stack the boxes like that!&rsquo;
or, &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t they just put the toilet seat down!&rsquo;, or&hellip; [insert annoyance here]) but I frown and shake it off and continue with the day. But it is
still there; underneath, the shark is joined by another. </p>
<p class='process-quote'>Seemingly trivial irritants continue (a friend cancels golf at the last minute; the sun is too bright; a partner doesn&rsquo;t answer a text; a co-worker
takes yet &ldquo;another&rsquo; smoke break; someone snaps their gum too loudly; a car cuts in front of yours; someone else&rsquo;s child is screaming; it&rsquo;s raining) &mdash; I
push the irritation I feel down, because that&rsquo;s what I have always done. The sharks gather, the water boils. </p>
<p class='process-quote'>Then &mdash; I answer my mobile. My partner asks me when I will be home, why I am late again, didn&rsquo;t I remember they had to go out! I hear the
kids yelling in the background. I snap back at them and push the phone roughly into my jacket pocket. I resent my partner for being unreasonable and
demanding but I finish up and leave work and slam the door on my way out. On the drive home, the motorway traffic is heavier, the drivers are more
stupid than usual. I sound the horn as I pass them (idiots!), my foot pressing on the accelerator. I don&rsquo;t realise until I park the car, how tightly
I had gripped the steering wheel.  </p>
<p>Imagine &mdash; what would a life time of constant irritations, that continually build to annoyance, anger and resentment, look like? &mdash; A
festering open wound delivering a slow poison: a cacophony of damaging chemicals that are the body&rsquo;s natural response to harmful emotion. The discomfort
and psychological, physical and emotional pain caused by this poison are intolerable, but you don&rsquo;t know how to make it go away. </p>
<p>What is it up until now, that has either, temporarily relieved the pressure, or, allowed us to explode, vent, or otherwise, go ballistic?  We have a
drink; alcohol has always been our fix.  </p>

		<p>These defects are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Selfish </strong>- lacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure.</li>
			<li><strong>Dishonest </strong>- We have lost the ability to be totally honest with ourselves or others and when we are, we usually hurt             other people or ourselves, usually by opening our mouths.</li>

			<li><strong>Inconsiderate </strong>- acting without consideration; thoughtless; rash.</li>

		<p>We have many types of character defects and the ones above are our core basic defects.

		<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Self Esteem</strong> &mdash; How I think and feel about myself.</p>
			<p>Dad didn&rsquo;t come to my games &mdash; I&rsquo;d feel dejected and unloved. I saw the other kids&rsquo; parents there which made me feel bad about myself, and I knew dad was going to the hotel to drink.  </p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Pride</strong> &mdash; How I think others see me. </p>
			<p>When dad dropped me off I would imagine when other parents and kids looked at me and think I wasn&rsquo;t very good or that my father didn&rsquo;t like or love me.</p>  </li>
			<li><p><strong>Emotional Security</strong> &mdash; General sense of wellbeing, feeling emotionally stable and happy with myself.</p>
			<p>This was affected because I didn&rsquo;t feel emotionally stable and I wasn&rsquo;t happy about my dad going to the pub instead of watching my game. This affected my emotions greatly.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Financial</strong> &mdash; Basic desire for money, property and possessions.</p>
			<p>I wanted people to respect and love me. I wanted success.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Ambitions</strong> &mdash; My plans, dreams and goals for the future.</p>
			<p>No, if anything it made more determined.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Personal Relations</strong></p>
			<p>My relationship with my father was affected because his drinking was more important than spending time with me; also, he didn&rsquo;t communicate with me.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Sex Relations</strong></p>
			<p>Because of dad&rsquo;s inability to show me attention and love I went looking for other relationships with women and gangs etc.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> Shown in my example are how my Basic Instincts were affected by my father&rsquo;s behaviour. (Basic Instincts can sometimes be positive e.g. My father triggering my &ldquo;Financial&rdquo; Instinct made me determined to succeed financially.)</p>

		<p><strong>Mother &mdash; Pauline </strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Self Esteem </strong> &mdash; How I think and feel about myself. </p>
			<p>When my mother died I thought I was alone, and I had to be strong. I put up many barriers to keep people out. I didn&rsquo;t feel or think much about myself, I felt lonely and scared because I didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Pride</strong> &mdash; How I think other people view or feel about me.</p>
			<p>No. Not affected.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Emotional security</strong> &mdash; General sense of wellbeing, feeling emotionally stable with myself.

		<strong>My Part:   </strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Where was I to Blame?</li>
			<li>What was my part in this? </li>
			<li>What was the exact nature of my wrongs to this person, institution or principle?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In this column you focus only on the part you played (we do not blame others).  <p>
		<p>Column 4 is where we stop blaming others for our resentments, anger, hurt and/or feelings of being threatened & general ill will toward people, institutions and principles. </p>
		<p><strong>THIS IS WHERE WE GET TO THE ROOT CAUSES</strong></p>
		<p><strong>CRUCIAL READING</strong></p>
		<p>Remember, we are willing to go to every length to free ourselves from harmful emotions; it is only then we can release our addictions.  </p>
		<p>It is not possible to change others, but we can change ourselves, so it is crucial to find the part we played in each held resentment, no matter what. This is agreed to in the &ldquo;rule&rdquo; section: *You accept that your sobriety is your sole responsibility and that, although we deliver The Process to you, it is your responsibility to follow it thoroughly. We investigate ourselves truthfully even when we think we&rsquo;re innocent. This does not take away what people have done to us. </p>
		<p>Accept that we have no power over others and what they did to us, but we do have the power over what we do from here and into the future. </p>
		<p>We have blamed these people &mdash; but like us, they have been spiritually, emotionally and mentally unwell. They will carry this burden by themselves, sometimes to the grave.  </p>
		<p>I include the character defect - INCONSID<strong>Inconsiderate</strong>ERATE - in the next column to help you define how I considered I was to blame, the part I played, and the exact nature of my wrong. (If we can see we were inconsiderate, then this will set you free from resentment.) </p>
		<p>Now we&rsquo;ll focus only on our part. The following are examples and descriptions on how to forgive. To forgive is a choice. To forgive is a powerful step in resolving anger and resentment. Moving through the work quickly and thoughtfully. </p>
		<strong>INSERT EXAMPLE WORKSHEET AND I WILL DISCUSS HOW WE DO THIS, THESE ARE REAL EXAMPLES AND THIS COLUMN IS SO CRITICAL TO FREEDOM BECAUSE IT GIVES US THE ABILITY TO FORGIVE </strong>
		<p>When you are positive you fully understand and accept/acknowledge your part in each situation, and you honestly look at what your part is, in relation to each of these &mdash; you are on the highway to freedom.  </p>
		<p>Below again I have provided the examples of MY PART to assist you to find your part.</p>

		<p><strong>Father &mdash; Bernard </strong></p>
		<p>I realised my father was an alcoholic and he did not understand he had a problem. If he did, he did not know what to do about it. I am sure he didn&rsquo;t like his how his drinking controlled him. Dad was powerless over his drinking. He was a kind and generous man.</p><br/>

		<p><strong>Mother &mdash; Pauline </strong></p>
		<p>I realised that mum didn&rsquo;t want to die. Cancer took her, we were both powerless over cancer. It took her away from everyone. It wasn&rsquo;t her fault.</p><br/>
		<p><strong>Friend &mdash; Vernon </strong></p>
		<p>Vernon had a violent father and older brother who both bullied him. They would beat him up. He was scared and defensive. He was angry, and his only avenue was to bully me and others. When we grew bigger he stopped. </p><br/>
		<p><strong>Financial advisor &mdash; Steve </strong></p>
		<p>I should have listened to my wife and friends. I should have done the research on the company and known what they were investing my money in.  </p><br/>
		<p><strong>God </strong></p>
		<p>God didn&rsquo;t take my mother; cancer did. I realised I just needed someone to blame. </p><br/>
		<p><strong>Employer &mdash; Mr Talbot </strong></p>
		<p>I realised another person misinformed him about me, but I wanted to blame someone. I didn&rsquo;t like working there. </p><br/>
		<p><strong>Uncle &mdash; Selwyn </strong></p>
		<p>I realise he was a very sick man, mentally and emotionally. I also discovered he had been abused as a child by his teachers. He had never told anyone this until he was dying. I realised he had carried the burden of being abused and being an abuser himself. I realised Uncle Selwyn had been in a living hell all his life, although it didn&rsquo;t stop him from abusing me, I found space in my heart to forgive him. I wished him peace as I would anyone who was sick. </p>

		<p>As discussed in the last slide, you can now understand your default defects relative to each resentment you have held. </p>
		<p><strong>Read carefully below.</strong>  </p>
		<p>You may hold on to deep resentment and anger toward people and situations where you were clearly not at fault &mdash; that is natural. But you still have resentment. You need to let go of this residual resentment for a happy and contented life.  </p>
		<p>The last slide described how and when to use the <strong>inconsiderate</strong> defect. I showed how the people who harmed you, were <strong>spiritually, mentally</strong> and <strong>emotionally unwell</strong>. Knowing this allows us to understand we have fallen in to the default &mdash; INCONSIDERATE.  This will free us and allow us to begin to forgive and heal. And to forgive and heal means freedom. </p>

		<p>If you are confused at any stage please go back to the examples I have previously given you. </p>
		<p>When you seem to be stuck just keep moving forward, this is not about perfection it is about momentum and action. </p></strong>
		<p>Once you have completed your sheets on resentment and anger and are certain that you have covered all people, institutions and principles that you have resented, were angry at, hated, felt hurt or threatened by or felt ill will toward then you should now see how these resentments have had control over you and your life. </p>
		<p>To summarise the resentment and anger sheet. Even when something is not our fault and sometimes it is not. Someone may have done something unprovoked, we still have a way to deal with it. Even when we cannot find where we were at fault, we can find where our <strong>Reaction</strong> was at fault. </p>
		<p>Maybe we feel we have been offended and this may have caused us to be fearful, but in this program, we have learnt that we have an inner resource that allows us not to react in a fearful way to negative actions that come our way. </p>
		<p>As we start to see when our basic instincts are out of alignment we are instinctively aware which of the instincts are out of alignment and we can now adjust our reaction and actions, so they do not have control over us. Some of you will pray for guidance, some of you will meditate, others may contemplate, and others may just go and talk with a friend, but we must not think that we are the centre of the universe. </p>
		<p>Once Sheet 2 is completed you will have a process of working through for the rest of your life, yes, we have more work to complete but you have had a good look at yourself and how your anger and resentment has affected you and your life. Now you can start a fresh and this was the beginning. We are now going to address our fears in a similar way as to how we addressed our resentments and anger </p>

		"html" : "<h3>Column 1 - What am I Afraid Of?</h3>

		<p>We all have fears. Some are natural and we need these. Then there are fears that we just don&rsquo;t know where they come from and they can paralyse us into inaction. Fear steals from us and stops us growing into the person we really want to be.</p>
		<h3>Understanding Fear and Anxiety  </h3>
		<p>Fear starts with us becoming... </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Nervous about something or someone and then moves up the scale for us to become... </li>
			<li>Anxious about someone, something or we feel something could happen and then it moves into... </li>
			<li>Fear, and we become frightened that something bad is going to happen to us or someone else. </li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
		<p>Procrastination is another form of fear where we just keep putting things off until they cause us major problems, or we reluctantly address the problem and then wonder why we made it so hard for ourselves.  </p>
		<p>Many of you will have experienced the above emotions many times in your life and many of us have gone off to the Doctors and we are given some type of pill. Sometimes this is necessary, and it can be helpful, but what I see is many people staying on the prescribed pill and not coming off them. The fear or problem has not been addressed it has been cloaked over, so the fear or anxiety is still there. </p>
		<p>I will give you an example- I have a friend who has a bad hip and It occasionally causes him much pain. He sometimes takes an off the shelf pain killer and this relieves the pain for a period of time. The pain has been taken away, but the problem is still there waiting to cause him more problems, that is why we address resentment, anger and fear in The Process because you will be able to see where this comes from and how to remedy it, if you choose. </p>
		<p>Before you start I will again supply examples for you to follow and you can start filling in the fears prompt sheet. </p>

		<h3>YOUR ACTION</h3><p> - Please print the <u>Fears Prompt Sheet: Sheet 3 - Column 1</u></p>

			<li>Once we have done this we then transfer these into <u>Column 1 - What am I Afraid of? </u>On worksheet 4.</li>

	"html" : "<h3>Column 2 - Why do I Have the Fear?</h3>

	<p>As in the resentment and Anger prompt sheet I am going to write a small overview as to why I have these fears.</p>
	<p>You saw in the resentment and anger pages that by writing a little paragraph on each topic. This allows you to have a better understanding of the fear and will allow me to be condense this into a few words for the worksheet.</p>
	<p>Again the importance is for YOU to understand - nobody else - just you.</p>
	<p>Let us begin</p>
	<p><strong>Rejection </strong>- When I was we grew up in a predominately protestant community and we were catholic, and I attended the local catholic school. I wanted to go to a protestant school like my other mates, so I would be accepted. I thought that by going to a catholic school I was scared and felt that I was not like them and they would reject me.</p>
	<p><strong>Loneliness </strong>- Again when growing up I wanted for everyone to like me and I wanted to fit in with all the guys. I wanted to have friends. Also, my head told me lots of things.</p>
	<p><strong>Failure </strong>- Scared of not being good enough, when I was with people I wanted them to think I was smart or clever or good at things and this made me anxious as well.</p>
	<p><strong>Disapproval </strong>- Not being seen as being able to do things well. Being seen as not reliable or able to do things.</p>
	<p><strong>Poverty </strong>- We grew up poor and I hated not being to have new clothes, a nice car, to go on holidays, having no pocket money, watching mum and dad struggle. This also drove me to succeed.</p>
	<p><strong>Financial </strong>- I am scared of not being able to earn money and I did not want to be like my parents.</p>
	<p><strong>Procrastination </strong>- When I was young I was scared to do some things because I thought I wasn&rsquo;t good enough and other people thought I wasn&rsquo;t good enough. I always thought people who had more than me or were better than me at different things, that this made them better people than me. I wasn&rsquo;t confident in my abilities. This has been with me most of my life and has stopped me performing to my real ability.</p>
	<h3> YOUR ACTION</h3>
	<p>Now you can write your small overview for each of your fears and once you have completed these you can transfer a condensed version of these into <u>Column 2 - Why Do I Have the Fear</u>.</p>
	<p>Please use my example as to how I have condensed the information into Column 2.</p>
	<p>Now we take our paragraph and review each one to ensure we feel comfortable that we have the right words to describe each situation</p>
	<p>Once we are happy with the reason of why we have the fear, anxiety or nervousness we then move onto column 3.</p>
	<p><strong>REMEMBER </strong>- This is for YOUR benefit, it allows you to see and understand why you have the fear, once you understand why you have the fear it starts to have less control over you.</p>

	<p><strong>PLEASE STUDY AND UNDERSTAND EACH OF THE  3 SELF&rsquo;S,</strong> this is critically important to understand as you will see and start to understand how you can address your fears, anxiety and nervousness.</p>
	<p>These are:</p>
	<p><strong>Self-reliance</strong> - Reliance on ones, own capabilities, abilities, judgement, own power and resources rather than those of others.</p>
	<p><strong>Self-confidence</strong> - Trust in our ability and skills to achieve our goals, believing and knowing what we are capable of and what we are not capable of.</p>
	<p><strong>Self-discipline</strong> - The ability to control our feelings and emotions and overcome our weaknesses. To stick at a task or tasks. To see projects through to completion no matter how hard they become or what problems arise.</p>
	<p>Because I wrote a brief overview of why I have the fear, I can now see where  </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Self-reliance</li>
		<li>Self-confidence and </li>
		<li>Self-discipline failed me</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<p>It becomes simple when you have your overview, so let&rsquo;s have a look at what I do in my example in Column 3.
	<p><strong>Rejection </strong>- I wanted to be accepted by others.</p>
	<p>So what part of Self failed me? I ticked</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Self-Reliance </strong>- because I didn&rsquo;t believe in my own capabilities and didn&rsquo;t know what they were, also I did not have many positive or experienced mentors</li>
	<li><strong>Self Confidence </strong>- Because I didn&rsquo;t know my own capabilities I didn&rsquo;t know or have self-confidence.</li>
	</ul><br/>
	<p><strong>Loneliness </strong>- I wanted to be popular and liked by people. </p>
	<p>So, what part of Self, failed me? I ticked</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Self-Reliance </strong>- Again I didn&rsquo;t believe in my own capabilities as I didn&rsquo;t know what they were, and again not being mentored or guided.</li>
	<li><strong>Self Confidence </strong>- Again because I didn&rsquo;t know my own capabilities and skills and be confident to communicate with people. </li>
	</ul><br/>
	<p><strong>Failure </strong>- Was scared of not being good enough</p>
	<p>So, what part of Self failed me? I ticked</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Self-Reliance </strong>- I didn&rsquo;t have the belief or knowledge of my own capabilities and didn&rsquo;t trust my judgement.</li>
	<li><strong>Self Confidence </strong>- Because I didn&rsquo;t know my abilities or how good they were I wasn&rsquo;t confident to use my abilities, so I would not take risks because of becoming a failure.</li>
	<li><strong>Self-Discipline </strong>- I did try certain things because I knew I wasn&rsquo;t disciplined and knew I would have to stick at it and I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered because I thought it was too hard. </li>
	</ul><br/>
	<p><strong>Disapproval </strong>- I wanted to be liked and thought of well.</p>
	<p>So, what part of Self failed me? I ticked</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Self Confidence </strong>- I was not sure of my abilities so I would not push myself and if I did it would be under false confidence. I didn&rsquo;t like being told off for doing the wrong thing.</li>
	</ul><br/>
	<p><strong>Poverty </strong>- Being poor</p>
	<p>So, what part of Self failed me? I ticked</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Self Confidence </strong>- Not trusting my own abilities and again not thinking I was good enough</li>
	<li><strong>Self-Discipline </strong>- Not having the ability to see through and focus on skills that I needed, also not realising that study would help me.</li>
	</ul><br/>
	<p><strong>Financial </strong>- Not having enough money</p>
	<p>So, what part of Self failed me?</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Self-Reliance </strong>- I was not sure or positive about my skills, knowledge or my own power. I felt like an imposter.</li>
	<li><strong>Self Confidence </strong>- I didn&rsquo;t fully trust my skill or my own abilities.</li>
	<li><strong>Self-Discipline </strong>- I definitely didn&rsquo;t have the ability to control my feelings and to stick at the task.</li>

	<p><strong>Procrastination </strong>- Because I might fail.</p>
	<p>So, what part of Self failed me?</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Self-Reliance </strong>- I was scared to rely on my own capabilities and power.</li>
	<li><strong>Self Confidence </strong>- I didn&rsquo;t believe in my own capabilities all the time and didn&rsquo;t understand or realise of what I was or could be capable of.</li>
	<li><strong>Self-Discipline </strong>- I didn&rsquo;t have the discipline to stick to a task.</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<p>(<strong>NOTE: I strongly recommend </strong> that you do this as it gives much more clarity and allows you to start making changes in how you react to your fears, because you now understand why you have the fear and how it affects you, it allows you to plan how you will go forward so that the fear is eventually reduced or removed, the fear does not affect you because you understand it)</p>
	<h3>YOUR ACTION</h3>
	<p>Just like I have done above, write down </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Your Fear</li>
		<li>Why you have the Fear and</li>
		<li>Just like I did with Which Part of Self has Failed, write down the reasons.</li>
	</ol><br/>
	<p>I suggest that you place the definition I have provided on Self-Reliance, Self Confidence and Self-Discipline in front of you. As you go through this exercise you will start to see core reasons for the Fear developing.</p>
	<p>Once you have completed this exercise you will tick the relevant boxes in Column 3. </p>

	<p>Now, we are going to review which of the Basic Instincts these fears affect.</p>
	<p>Since you have already gone through this exercise when we worked through Resentments and Anger, we just follow that same process.</p>
	<p>Again, I am going to present my examples first and then have you complete yours.</p>
	<p>Example</p>
	<p><strong>Rejection </strong>- Affects my, (and why)</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Self-esteem - because I didn&rsquo;t feel equal with others.</li>
	<li>Pride - because I felt they didn&rsquo;t treat me as one of them because I was catholic. </li>
	<li>Emotional security -I didn&rsquo;t feel good enough.</li>
	<li>Personal relations - I was scared my friends wouldn&rsquo;t accept me and treat me as an equal because of being catholic.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Loneliness </strong>- Affects my, (and why)</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Self-esteem - I wanted to be like them and didn&rsquo;t feel I was.</li>
	<li>Pride - I felt as if they saw me differently.</li>
	<li>Emotional security - No one liking me because I was different.</li>
	<li>Personal relations - My friends wouldn&rsquo;t like me because I was not like them or I was different.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Failure </strong>- Affects my, (and why)</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Self-esteem - If I fail I won&rsquo;t feel good about myself</li>
	<li>Pride - Other people will think less of me.</li>
	<li>Emotional security - I will get upset emotionally.</li>
	<li>Personal relations - I will let my family and others down.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Financial </strong> - Affects my, (and why)</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Self-esteem - Because I don&rsquo;t want to be poor</li>
	<li>Pride - People won&rsquo;t respect me.</li>
	<li>Emotional security - I will feel worthless.</li>
	<li>Financial - I won&rsquo;t have money or assets.</li>
	<li>Ambitions - It could stop me achieving my dreams.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I haven&rsquo;t included examples of all the fears as I know you will be gaining a better understanding of how this works.</p>
	<p><strong>NOTE: AGAIN I SUGGEST STRONGLY</strong> that you follow my example and write out why you think, your basic instincts are affected. This is again a powerful process as by thinking and writing it down gives you clarity and power, as you are going through this process you will find the fear and anxiety having less power over you. It starts leaving you.</p>

This is a very straight forward process but needs to be done honestly and again, please do not leave any one off the list who you know you have hurt by your actions. We are not concerned with their behaviour, as this is not our business. We are seeing only who we have hurt.</p>
	<p><strong>Column 1 - Who did I hurt</strong></p>

		<li>Coca-Cola - I stole product from them.</li>
		<li>Girlfriends -I had other relationships when I was still with them.</li>

	<ul>
		<li><p><strong>Carl - I beat him up</strong></p>
		<p>Self-esteem - I didn&rsquo;t feel good about myself for doing it.</p>
		<p>Pride - I thought people thought I was a bully.</p>
		<p>Personal relations - Carl was one of my best mates.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Mum - I stole money from her</strong></p>
		<p>Self-esteem - I felt bad for doing because mum and dad didn&rsquo;t have much money.</p>
		<p>Pride - I felt they saw me as a thief (which I was)</p>
		<p>Emotional security - My emotions of shame and guilt were strong.</p>
		<p>Personal relations - I let my mum and dad done and hurt them.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Coca-Cola - I stole boxes of coke.</strong></p>
		<p>Emotional security - I felt bad for doing it.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Girlfriends - I played around on them.</strong></p>
		<p>Self-esteem - When I played around on them I always felt bad after.</p>
		<p>Emotional security - Again after I had been with another women, my emotions of guilt and shame would arise.</p>
		<p>Personal relations - I would become distant to my current partner at the time and not communicate.</p>
		<p>Sex relations - When I had been with another person I would not be intimate with my partner.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Tom - I stole time from him.</strong></p>
		<p>Self-esteem - Because I lied to him it made me feel bad about myself</p>
		<p>Personal Relations - Tom was good to me but I felt like i let him down</p></li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<p><strong>Column 4 - What should I have done instead?</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Carl - I should have let him go first instead of pushing in and then beating him up.</li>
		<li>Mum - I should have not taken her money. I could have got a job or even asked for it.</li>
		<li>Coca-Cola &mdash; I should have asked if I could have some Coke.</li>
		<li>Girlfriends - I should have been faithful.</li>
		<li>Employer - I should have found another job.</li>

	<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> SEX - We are not here to judge your sex behaviour, that is your business. When we review our past sex behaviours we look at where we had been selfish, self-seeking, dishonest or inconsiderate, and who we had hurt. We review and ask ourselves what I should have done. Sometimes we seek out counselling if sex is still a problem, but if we are honest about our past behaviours and we are wanting to change we stop being selfish and start thinking of other people&rsquo;s needs.</p>

	<p><strong>Reviewing what we have just achieved </strong></p>
	<p>You have now completed the first part of phase 2, you should be proud of yourself as you have accomplished what most people never do in an entire lifetime. </p>
	<p>You now know, our defects affect other people and they react. If we can remove our defects of character, <strong>Selfishness, Self-Seeking, Dishonesty, Fear and Lack of Consideration,</strong> our basic instincts will be healthy especially when you replace those defects with healthy ones, selfless, putting others before ourselves, honesty, courage and being considerate of others.</p>

	<p>Please choose very carefully and we strongly suggest you only go to a person who will treat your information with total and the utmost confidentiality.</p>
	<p>This is a very critical part of 'The Process' and if not carried out quickly or not carried out at all because you have some fear or trepidation, please trust me when I say that YOU are the one who will benefit from this immensely.</p>
	<h3>Guidelines for transference</h3>
	<p>Once you have chosen who your trusted source will be, you go to them and explain that you are working a program that will help you be free from alcohol and that this is a critical, as if we do not do this we may drink again.</p>
	<p>Explain that this is a life and death task.</p>

	<p>When we have completed this phase of the program we will feel a new freedom, our fears and resentment will seem to fall away. It may feel that you have been relieved of your drinking problem.</p>

		<li>You next put a plus (+) or minus (-) sign next to each name on your list. The plus (+) means that you are willing and happy to make the amends and the minus (-) is that you are not yet ready to make the amends just yet but will when the time feels right.

	<h3>Guidelines for Making the Amends</h3>
	<p>This is the last part of phase 2 but it is the most powerful as we become totally free from the past.</p>
	<p>We have taken ownership of our defects, our hurts, resentments, fears and our actions.</p>
	<p>We realise how much damage we have done to others and how our actions have hurt ourselves.</p>
	<p>Before we go to these people to make our amends we ask ourselves the following questions </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Why am I making the amends?</li>
		<li>Will this amends in anyway hurt the people I am making the amends to?</li>
		<li>Will my family be hurt in anyway if I make these amends?</li>
		<li>If the amends will hurt anyone, what else can I do to put the situation right?</li>
		<li>If a person we owe an amends to still feels aggrieved by our actions, we may choose to postpone this action.</li>
		<li>We will be sincere in our desire to set things right with people a simple sorry is not an amends.</li>
		<li>As with the Uncle Selwyn resentment- You may choose to go and forgive him in person, this is your choice.</li>
		<li>When we do go to a person who has harmed us, it takes great courage, but it benefits us greatly.</li>
		<li>We are only looking at our faults we are not looking at their faults.</li>
		<li>We are cleaning our side of the street, not theirs.</li>
		<li>If we owe money we either pay it back or come to some arrangement.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>These guidelines are exactly that and if you honest and open you will know a new freedom.</p>
	<p>Once you have finished making you amends you will have completed Phase 2 of 'The Process'</p>
	<p>When you make your first amends you will need to move directly onto Phase 3 of 'The Process'</p>

	"html" : "<h3>PHASE 3- Continuing to grow and understand both ourselves and others </h3>
	<p>I will now show you how to use 'The Process' on a daily basis. Assuming you are making your amends to the people on your list </p>
	<p>Now that you are making your amends you will want to continue to grow and flourish with this new way of living, we will need to continue taking our inventory on a daily basis and watch out for selfishness, self-seeking, dishonesty, fear and being inconsiderate. </p>
	<p>I will provide you an example of how you can quickly analyse yourself immediately on a daily basis and when you become irritated, annoyed, angry, resentful, fearful or I have hurt/harmed someone.</p>
	<p><strong>Anger and resentment </strong>- I can quickly go through 'The Process' quickly and see where my basic instincts were out of alignment, what was my part in this (where was I to blame) and what were my defects and I now know what action I need to take. I can then make an amends as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p><strong>Fear </strong>- Why I had the fear, what part of self, failed me and what basic instincts the fear affected and what were my defects of character and then I can take action to correct this immediately.</p>
	<p><strong>Harms done to others </strong>- I can see who I hurt and what I did, I can see which of the basic instincts were affected and I can correct my behaviour. Then I can make an amends as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p>-I can now see my part in each situation very quickly and I can take action quickly, if you follow 'The Process' directions you will live a life that is exciting, amazing and be free.</p>
	<p>-As we practice this way of living it actually becomes so natural and freeing. </p>
	<p><strong>-BUT WE MUST PRACTICE THIS WAY OF LIVING EACH AND EVERY DAY TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY. </strong></p>
	<p><strong>-DO NOT LET IRRITATION BUILD INTO RESENTMENT.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>-DON&rsquo;T LET FEAR CONTROL YOU OR DON&rsquo;T LET NERVOUSNESS, ANXIETY MOVE INTO FEAR. </strong></p>
	<p><strong>-WHEN WE HURT SOMEONE, OR PEOPLE RETALIATE FIX IT UP QUICKLY AND MAKE THE AMENDS FOR YOUR PART.</strong></p>
	<br/>
	<h3>New Actions and new Behaviour needed</h3>
	<p>We will need and want to start repairing the damage we have created through our drinking. The first place we start with is with ourselves in the way we act and behave and below is a short list of the people we may have upset, damaged, hurt, and I am sure there are a few more words you could add.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Parents/Grandparents</li>
		<li>Wife or partner</li>
		<li>Children</li>
		<li>Brothers and sisters</li>
		<li>Uncles and aunties.</li>
		<li>Friends</li>
		<li>Work</li>
		<li>Work colleagues</li>
	</ol>
	<p>You can add other names, but the bottom line is that we now have to start practicing this new way of living.</p>
	<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We will be measured by our <strong>ACTIONS</strong> not by our INTENTIONS.</p>
	<p>We have a long road to recovery and repairing the damage we have caused, but this actually does not take long if we are honest and sincere with what we are trying to achieve.</p>
	<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> After a short period of sobriety we will notice the changes in ourselves and we may notice that the people closest to us still have their old behaviour, this is normal, even if they treat us in their old ways we do not react like we used to, be are tolerant and loving towards all people and we are there to be of service. We are no longer are judging everyone and just because we are sober that does not give us the right to say to everyone, look at me, I got sober for these people they treat me so badly, this will definitely lead us back to the drink.</p>
	<br/>
	<h3>CRITICAL</h3>
	<strong>The 3 reasons someone drinks again are</strong>
	<ol>
		<li>You get resentful and hold onto the resentment- In other words you stop practicing 'The Process'.</li>
		<li>You have held onto something you should have written down and shared. â€œYOUR SECRETâ€�</li>
		<li>You are either still selfish and self-seeking, dishonest, frightened or inconsiderate and while things have gotten better you still make everything about you and when you are helpful to others you treat it as a notch on your belt and have some expectation that someone owes you something in return.</li>
	<p><strong>NOTE - These are the only reasons people drink again.</strong></p>

	<p>These are the directions for living on a daily basis, it starts when we first awaken, not when we get up and have a coffee, or after our shower, or after we talk with our wife. <strong>It starts when our eyes open</strong> so here are the directions for you to live on a daily basis.</p>
	<h3>When we awaken</h3>
	<p>When you wake up you mentally start planning your day, but before you start planning you make a decision to be caring, self-less, honest, courageous and considerate and you also will plan to be free from self-pity.</p>
	<p>Now you start planning your day mentally, outlining your actions, plans, meetings, and the outcomes you are planning.</p>
	<p>Once, this is done you may decide to meditate, pray or just contemplate your day for a while. This action helps us to have clarity and also it helps stop the mind wandering.</p>
	<p>We arise and get on with daily life.</p>

	<h3>As we are going through the day<h3>
	<p>As we go through the day we see where we can add value to people&rsquo;s lives in a positive way, we try to be of use and helpful to all those we interact with, we are selfless and interested in other people. </p>
	<p>When we become annoyed or irritated, or anxious we pause for a while and review which of our basic instincts have been affected and we ask ourselves why this has happened, because you now have worked 'The Process' you now know how to address this quickly.</p>
	<p>During the day you may find yourself being unsure of what actions to take, our suggestion here is to just stop and take it easy, we relax, and the answers will come.</p>
	<p>As you practice this on a daily basis you will find yourself at ease with people and the world about you. You will be living life on life&rsquo;s terms. You will be free.</p>

	<h3>When we retire at night</h3>
	<p>Just before we go to sleep, we review our day mentally and we go thoroughly over the day and ask ourselves the following questions</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Have I been annoyed, irritated, angry or resentful with anyone?</li>
		<li>Have I been anxious or fearful?</li>
		<li>Have I harmed been rude or blunt to anyone?</li>
		<li>Have my plans been disrupted or interfered with?</li>
		<li>Do I owe anyone any amends?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If the answer is no then that is great, you have had a great day without alcohol and are now living life free.</p>
	<p>If the answer is yes then you write it down and attend to it the next day, if you see that you need to make an amends to someone then put their name down on paper and attend to that as soon as possible on the next day.</p>

	<p>We have cleaned up our past and we have learnt a new way of living, the desire to drink has most probably been removed and if it has not then it will eventually just leave you.</p>
	<p>You now have choices in how you want your life to be and you have started an amazing journey that you will not regret. I wish you all the best on your journey of discovery and growth</p>
	<p>It is important to keep being of service to our fellow people and to keep practicing 'The Process' everyday as you have been shown, very quickly it will become integrated into your mind and it will be so natural that you will be amazed at who you have become. You won&rsquo;t forget your past as this has held the key to your future and will allow you to help others, which I will show you very soon.</p>
	<p>You now have the tools for a new way of living, and we have created an on-line community that will ensure that we have a support network for us to tap into and also to be able to help others, in the next video I am going to explain how the community works and how it benefits you and your fellow community members.</p>
	<p><strong>NOTE: REMEMBER THIS IS A LIFELONG PROCESS AND WE NEED SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WHERE WE HAVE BEEN</strong></p>

	"phaseId" : 3,
	"stepNumber" : 4,
	"html" : "<h3>An Introduction to the Recovered Community and the Benefits to YOU. </h3>
	<p>The online <strong>RECOVERED COMMUNITY</strong> is an anonymous community that allows people who have been through 'The Process' to be able to seek support, knowledge and friendship in a private online environment without having to go off to meetings, or to councillors, psychologist&rsquo;s but have a place where they can firstly use 'The Process' and then if still having problems they can share their problem with the community anonymously and without judgement</p>
	<strong>Benefits</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>A community who understand and have empathy with where we all have been</li>
		<li>No judgement</li>
		<li>You are Anonymous</li>
		<li>Private community</li>
		<li>Seek help anytime anywhere</li>
		<li>No meetings to attend</li>
		<li>Ability to help and be helped by the community</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<h3>Guidelines for being a member in the online community.</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>No negative talk to others &mdash; We may share a story and it may have negative content- that is ok as this is usual when someone is going through troubling times, we are all here to help and support each other.</li>
		<br/>
		<li>We can only bring a story to the community after we have worked through 'The Process' and you feel you want to share your experience, or you are looking for more guidance, you also just might want to share it as a positive experience.</li>
		<br/>
		<li>When dealing with other people&rsquo;s problems we do not try and become the analyst or councillor, the reason for this is that each person who is in the community has had their experience and each person&rsquo;s experience is special and unique to them and we do not want this to change.</li>
		<br/>
		<li>Where we can be of benefit is when we see where they may be stuck- for example- their part in a resentment or they are having trouble with an area within fear, this is where we can help them through this.</li>
		<br/>
		<li>We do not bring or discuss any religion or beliefs we may have.</li>
		<br/>
		<li>We are all dealing with each other&rsquo;s lives and we need to be loving, understanding and patients.</li>
		<br/>
		<li>We must be practicing &ldquo;The Process&rdquo; on a daily basis as this is how we grow and when we grow we can share our experience to help and inspire others.</li>
		<br/>
		<li>This is a TOTALLY PRIVATE COMMUNITY and is open ONLY TO MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE PROCESS.</li>
	</ul>
