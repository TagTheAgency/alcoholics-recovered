      <h3>Tony's Story</h3>
          <p>I've always done okay in life. Did I have a problem? Eventually, I saw that my problem was that I wasn't who I wanted to be. I was drinking every day, damaging my health and not happy. I thought …. "F*** it …I'm better than this!"</p>
          <p>Psychologists were too soft & ‘touchy-feely'. Other quit programs were weeks of meetings that I got lost in. I even did money on a retreat! Scouring the Internet, I was surprised at how little help is on offer. Guess why; alcohol addiction is a complex puzzle that is sometimes almost impossible to unravel. That's why most therapy fails.</p>
          <p>The ‘Alcoholics Recovered' site was convincing enough to give me hope. I was wary, but Paul's video quickly gave me a lesson in tough love and playing ‘grown-ups'. Then I realized that his style is not only a part of his earthy compassion, kindness and humanity but also because he himself has done the hard yards on the tough side of life. He's come out of it with beautiful values, which he's working hard at sharing. In any case, frankness is a key component in deleting the alcoholic disability from our lives.</p>
          <p>I now see how we all have our own set of complexities, which is impossible for us to sort for ourselves. Paul has amazingly formulated ‘The Process' that allows us to methodically lay it bare. It is exhausting and intensive, simple and brilliant. Best of all, I've got awareness mechanisms, an approach to life to maintain sobriety for the rest of my days. Yippee!</p>
          <p>It's hard for me to comprehend that after completing "The Process"</p> that I'm different. I understand what's been going on in this head of mine that had convinced it stupid self that it didn't have a problem. When I think about how much cash I was spending at the liquor shop, this is the best investment I ever made.</p>
          <p>Hey world…. watch me fly!</p>
