      <h3>Tony's Story</h3>
          <p>I've always done okay in life. Did I have a problem? Eventually, I saw that my problem was that I wasn't who I wanted to be. I was drinking every day, damaging my health and not happy. I thought... "F*** it ...I'm better than this!"</p>
          <p>Psychologists were too soft and "touchy-feely". Other quit programs were weeks of meetings that I got lost in. I even did money on a retreat! Scouring the Internet, I was surprised at how little help is on offer. Guess why; alcohol addiction is a complex puzzle that is sometimes almost impossible to unravel. That's why most therapy fails.</p>
          <p>The "Alcoholics Recovered" site was convincing enough to give me hope. I was wary, but Paul's video quickly gave me a lesson in tough love and playing "grown-ups". Then I realized that his style is not only a part of his earthy compassion, kindness and humanity but also because he himself has done the hard yards on the tough side of life. He's come out of it with beautiful values, which he's working hard at sharing. In any case, frankness is a key component in deleting the alcoholic disability from our lives.</p>
          <p>I now see how we all have our own set of complexities, which is impossible for us to sort for ourselves. Paul has amazingly formulated "The Process" that allows us to methodically lay it bare. It is exhausting and intensive, simple and brilliant. Best of all, I've got awareness mechanisms, an approach to life to maintain sobriety for the rest of my days. Yippee!</p>
          <p>It's hard for me to comprehend that after completing "The Process" that I'm different. I understand what's been going on in this head of mine that had convinced it stupid self that it didn't have a problem. When I think about how much cash I was spending at the liquor shop, this is the best investment I ever made.</p>
          <p>Hey world... watch me fly!</p>

        <h3>Tracy's Story</h3>
          <p>I had been in AA for nearly 20 years but only managed to stay sober for periods up to 1 to 2 years in that time. During this 20-year period I had numerous sponsors, had been through the steps repeatedly, but always ended up drinking.</p>
          <p>It became clear the AA program was not working for me. I had been drinking again and had, had enough of AA and felt suicidal.</p>
          <p>I made a commitment and I enrolled in "The Process". After completing "The Process" I was ecstatic and over the moon. I stayed sober for about 6 months then drank again, I then realised that I was still holding onto a resentment I had not worked through. I remembered when I first went through "The Process" that it explained that some people do drink again, and it is for three reasons. </p>
          <p>So, I went through the relapse version of "The Process" and have not drunk since. </p>
          <p>It has been 8 years since my last drink.</p>

          <h3>Di's Story</h3>
            <p>I was desperate, scared and felt alone.</p>
            <p>My life was overwhelming me, I couldn't stop drinking, every day I promised myself I'd stop. Every day I'd drink. To be social, because I had a bad day because I felt like one, - just one, but I couldn't stop at one. I am an alcoholic.</p>
            <p>I have a great life (most of the time), I have a good job I enjoy, I'm studying, I exercise, I'm doing alright financially, my home life is good (when I'm not drunk). But I drink and that's when I hurt the people I most care about. I've drunk all my adult life, I've had times when I've stopped for short periods, usually after being drunk and horrid. It's never lasted. I couldn't do it alone, I needed help.</p>
            <p>I found "The Process" and Paul's video gave me a reason to try, he knew what I was going through. He explained what it was to be an alcoholic, everything I was. I felt relief and hope, I trusted Paul and knew it was my time to make that step. I had to really want to stop and be serious about fixing my problems.             </p>
            <p>'The Process' have made sense of my problems, together I've worked through the many issues in my life. </p>
            <p>I am now sober. I will be forever. </p>
            <p>Make that call, don't live through hell. Stop hurting yourself and the ones you love, there is a wonderful world to enjoy.</p>

            <h3>A Late Awakening</h3>
              <p>At the age of 60 my life had recycled and hit a new low - my third marriage was failing, my professional career was on the brink of collapsing, my children and friends were withdrawing from me and I could see another bout of depression and further suicide attempts were approaching from the shadows. Obese, hypertensive high cholesterol and lipids with poor sleep patterns and aching joints told me my body was yearning for a change - or else!</p>
              <p>Since the age of 15 I had enjoyed alcohol and drugs of all kinds and thought "I could handle them".</p>
              <p>I had had anger management issues which had resulted in the police calling over the years and now found myself with my third ADVO - one for each wife.</p>
              <p>I had always thought other people were to blame particularly my wives but in desperation I wondered if just possibly I might be the problem, in particular my D and A issues.</p>
              <p>So as a health professional I turned to Dr Google to see what I could do and what might give me the best chance of a successful recovery and a new healthy lifestyle.</p>
              <p>I happened upon Paul and "The Process" with support from my long-suffering wife I enrolled in "The Process."</p>
              <p>The next few days were the last of a disastrous holiday and I spent the bulk of each day writing and working through the tough emotions and reality of my self-inflicted predicament. In desperation I embraced the need to recruit my higher power into my recovery - and so my sober life began.</p>
              <p>I worked each day on my anger, resentments and fears and let go of the same. I undertook to be of service to those around me and to "keep my side of the street tidy"</p>
              <p>Now months down the track I don't miss alcohol, my hypertension and high cholesterol have both normalised, I have lost 5kg and my life is back on track.</p>
              <p>I humbly plan each day, review how I could have done things better and make amends as needs be.</p>
              <p>Without anger and resentment my fear has been resolved, and I enjoy each day.</p>
              <p>Thanks Paul.</p>
              <p>If alcohol or drugs have control over you, I thoroughly recommend Paul and "The Process"</p>
              <p>Take back your life and health and live again.            </p>

              <h3>Dan's Story</h3>
                <p>I've never met Paul, but we have talked many times on the telephone. Despite having never seen him in person, Paul and "The Process" played the major part in bringing me back from the brink of a life crisis I wasn"t capable of dealing with.</p>
                <p>A relationship breakup hit me hard, and in the aftermath, my long-dormant addiction came charging back. I had been attending AA meetings for over 4 years. In a short period of time, "The Process's" sensible and powerful formula took me back to feeling accepting and empowered. Not only did it straighten me out - returning me to a place of calm - but I felt I had an improved approach to everything. I have never felt better. It's too simple and effective not to try - it would enhance anyone's life. </p>
                <p>I endorse and encourage anyone who is struggling with alcohol addiction to commit to "The Process", I know it has worked for so many people but more importantly it saved my life.</p>

                <h3>Rob's Story</h3>
                  <p>"The Process" had an extremely effective and uncomplicated approach to getting me sober and staying sober. It helped me to let go of past resentments and to recognise my part in holding on to these. To stop blaming others and to take responsibility for my behaviour and for my emotions.</p>
                  <p>Instead of being stuck in a cycle of shame and guilt because of alcohol abuse, I feel I am continually moving forward and living my life more and more in the present moment... in the world instead of in my head.</p>
                  <p>"The Process" has helped me to be more connected to, and understanding of myself, and therefore of everyone else in the world.</p>
                  <p>Ultimately to approach life in a more empowered, positive and optimistic way with a lot less inclination to avoid and escape from uncomfortable feelings or fall into old patterns of self-pity.</p>
                  <p>The 3-phase process over 5 days which I learnt was <ol>
                    <li>Admitting I had a problem and then moved quickly into the solution.</li>
                    <li>To review anger, resentments, anxieties, fears and the people I had hurt.</li>
                    <li>Processes for living sober.</li>
                  </ol></p>
                  <p>"The Process" takes only 5 days and the outcome was amazing and liberating, it was as though my alcohol problem had been removed.</p>
                  <p>I am now 3 years sober and free from alcohol and drugs and although occasionally I will think about a drink, it is fleeting. </p>
                  <p>I do not hesitate to recommend "The Process" and would encourage anyone who is looking for freedom from alcohol to invest in "The Process".</p>
