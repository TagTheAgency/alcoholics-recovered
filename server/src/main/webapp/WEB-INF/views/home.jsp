									 be more aware next time." The trouble is you won't. You don't know when or how to stop... but you can't stop!

				 <p>"The 'Alcoholics Recovered' site was convincing enough to give me hope. I was wary, but Paul's video quickly gave me a lesson in tough love and playing 'grown-ups'. Then I realized that his style is not only a part of his earthy compassion, kindness and humanity but also because he himself has done the hard yards on the tough side of life. He's come out of it with beautiful values, which he's working hard at sharing. In any case, frankness is a key component in deleting the alcoholic disability from our lives..."
