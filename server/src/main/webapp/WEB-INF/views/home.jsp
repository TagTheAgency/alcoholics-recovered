					<h3 class="small-header">The Process</h3>
					<h2>We've been where you are right now.</h2><br/>
					<h5>The loss of control of your life and the loss of control in yourself. You know you're in trouble - you feel it every day, people you love are being hurt because of it - yet you lie to yourself. "It's not that bad, I'll
             be more aware next time." The trouble is you won't. You don't know when or how to stop... but you can't stop!
					</h5><br/>
					<h5>
            The Process consists of just three phases and has been achieving amazing results with the people we help. We firmly believe that anyone who suffers from our affliction can get sober 
            forever if they have the capacity to be honest and take responsibility for their actions, behaviours and their life.
