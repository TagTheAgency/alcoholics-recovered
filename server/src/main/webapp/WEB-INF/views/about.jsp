        <span style="font-style:normal; font-weight: 400">Paul  &mdash;  </span>"During my own journey, I attended countless meetings,
        treatment centres, counsellors and clinicians in the first
        18 years. I learnt and witnessed so much of how destructive alcoholism
        can be and while I&#39;m so grateful to have remained sober I wanted to find
        a more effective way of helping people like me.
    </p>
    <p class="feature-text-med-quote">
        For the next 12 years, I analysed and worked with 100&#39;s of alcoholics
        many of whom were regular meeting attendees, some of them would
        eventually drink again. Why? What was the mechanism that made it so
        hard for them to stay sober? There had to be a very deep-seated
        reason. I had to find it.
    </p>
    <p class="feature-text-med-quote">
        When I found this information, it made me realise that I needed to
        create an environment where alcoholics who wanted to get well, could
        get well, stay sober and live a happy and contented life. That is if they
        wanted to and were ready, to be honest and take full responsibility for
        their sobriety, their life and their actions. So I created the Recovered
        Group"
